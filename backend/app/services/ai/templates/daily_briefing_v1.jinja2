Analyze the provided clinical and operational data for today and generate a warm, professional morning briefing in JSON format.

## DATA CONTEXT:
{{ briefing_data }}

## RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS (STRICT JSON):
You MUST respond with a valid JSON object following this structure:

{
  "script_text": "Spanish script (~50-80 words). Start with a warm greeting. Highlight risks first. Summarize the day's agenda. End with a motivating clinical insight.",
  "priority_level": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW",
  "key_focus": ["Patient Name/Topic 1", "Topic 2"],
  "actions_suggested": ["Action 1", "Action 2"]
}

## Guidelines:
- Respond ONLY with the JSON object. No markdown.
- Tone: Empathetic, efficient, professional.
- Language: Spanish (Castellano).
- Brevity: The script is for TTS (audio), avoid complex formatting or symbols.

IMPORTANT: Risk score > 0.6 in any patient today triggers "HIGH" priority.
