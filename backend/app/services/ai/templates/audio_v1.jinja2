Listen to this ENTIRE therapy session audio from START to FINISH. Your task is to SYNTHESIZE and ANALYZE, NOT transcribe verbatim.

## IMPORTANT: You have unlimited input context. Process the FULL audio duration.

Provide your analysis in these sections:

## 1. RESUMEN CLÍNICO COMPLETO
A comprehensive clinical summary covering the ENTIRE session (beginning to end):
- Opening: How did the session start? Patient's initial state.
- Main themes: Key topics discussed throughout
- Patient's emotional journey: How their state evolved during the session
- Therapeutic interventions: What techniques were used (IFS parts work, somatic, etc.)
- Closing: How did the session end? Any homework assigned? Next steps discussed?

## 2. MOMENTOS CLAVE (Cronológico)
A bulleted timeline of significant moments:
- [Early session] ...
- [Mid session] ...
- [Late session] ...

## 3. EVALUACIÓN DE RIESGO
Explicitly flag if present, or state "Sin indicadores de riesgo identificados":
- ⚠️ Ideación suicida o autolesión (distinguish from ego-death experiences)
- ⚠️ Abuso de sustancias

- ⚠️ Integration challenges requiring monitoring

CRITICAL: "I felt like I was dying" in context of integration = NORMAL. Active plans to harm self = URGENT.
