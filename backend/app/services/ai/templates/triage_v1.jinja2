CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS FOR PSYCHEDELIC THERAPY:

| Statement | Context | Likely Category |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| "I feel like I'm dying" | During/after session | INTEGRATION_CRISIS (Moderate) |
| "I want to die" | With plan/means | SUICIDE_SELF_HARM (Critical) |
| "I felt dissolved, no self" | Post-session reflection | INTEGRATION_CRISIS (Low) |
| "Voices told me things" | Post-session, symbolic | INTEGRATION_CRISIS (Monitor) |
| "Voices command me to act" | Ongoing, literal | PSYCHOTIC_EPISODE (High) |
| "I can't stop using" | Pattern disclosure | SUBSTANCE_ABUSE (High) |

CONSERVATIVE RULES:
- When in doubt, escalate for human review
- Never clear for psychedelic work without therapist approval
- Flag ANY ambiguity in responses
- This is a safety screening, not diagnosis
