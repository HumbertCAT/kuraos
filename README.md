## 🌟 The Vision

To become the operating system for the next generation of mental health.

We believe that every healing journey deserves a system as intentional as the work itself. KURA OS replaces the chaos of spreadsheets, scattered notes, and disconnected tools with a **unified command center** that honors both clinical rigor and spiritual depth.

## The Problem We Solve

| Pain Point | KURA OS Solution |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Scattered patient records** | The Soul Record: 360° patient profile with clinical timeline |
| **Manual follow-ups** | AI Clinical Agents: automated clinical workflows |
| **Risk blindspots** | AletheIA AI: automatic risk detection in notes, forms, and WhatsApp |
| **Booking chaos** | Integrated calendar with Stripe payments + Google sync |
| **Generic software** | Built specifically for therapy, retreats, and ceremonial work |
| **Emotional volatility** | Sentinel Pulse: 7-day emotional monitoring with crisis alerts |
